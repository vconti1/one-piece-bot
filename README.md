# 🏴‍☠️ One Piece Chapter Release Bot

A Discord bot that automatically posts when a **new English chapter** is released on **MangaDex** for a specified series.  
Built with **Node.js 20+** and **discord.js v14**.

This bot is currently configured to pull the latest One Piece chapter via the MangaDex API. If you'd like to use this bot 
for other manga, simply initialize the mangadex_id field with a manga ID provided by MangaDex.
